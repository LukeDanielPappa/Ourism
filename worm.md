The diffused essence of simplicity defines our existence--complex truths are extrapolated from foundational principles, sophisticated experiences interweave primordial qualia, and all conceivable assemblages of matter can be explained by a small set of elementary particles. The purest, most concentrated essence of being is thus a unitive simplicity beyond all categories, distinctions, and attributes. 

To realize this highest state is our purpose, as is evidenced by two facts so immanent to the human race that we struggle to recognize them. The first is that our universe is suitable for the creation of life. Physicists today estimate that if the values of the fundamental constants were variable, the probability of the cosmos being life-compatible by chance would be so astronomically low as to be zero. Of equally low probability is the coincidence that one's stream of consciousness rose from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness, given the physical scarcity of intelligent life in the universe. This second fact can only be explained by the MWI, a theory which posits that many timelines exist--of which we only perceive one. The timeline perceived is evidently one which leads the individual to the highest state of being.

Detatchment from all derivative identities to reveal the what was always within is the path toward accomplishing your purpose. These derivative identities include outcomes, possessions, beliefs, pleasures, pains, desires, and the ego. Fortunately, opportunities to let go will arise constantly in day to day life.
