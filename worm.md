The variety and intricacy of our world is the diffused essence of simplicity. Consider how complex truths are extrapolated from foundational principles, sophisticated experiences interweave primordial qualia, and every possible configuration of matter is rooted in a small set of elementary particles. Walking backwards, the quintessence of existence must therfore be a pure simplicity beyond all categories, distinctions, and attributes.

Three equivalent categories of being emerge from the ineffable--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields represent mental activity, or experience, which accordingly ranges in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality.

One's fate is to realize pure being, as is evidenced by two facts so deeply woven into the human condition that their significance escapes us. The first is that our universe is suitable for the creation of intelligent life. Physicists today estimate that if the values of the fundamental constants were variable, the probability of the cosmos being life-compatible by chance would be so astronomically low as to be zero. But regardless of the true odds, reality indisputably creates complex life--and this alone can't be dismissed.

The second fact is simply that you are an intelligent being. The particular physical configuration of our universe rose your stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. Given the corporeal scarcity and existential significance of higher-order life, this is a degree of personal fortune that defies all probabilistic expectations. To explain it we must invoke the MWI, a theory which posits the existence of countless branching timelines--of which you only perceive one. The timeline perceived would then be the one which leads you to the highest state of being. That way, every stream of consciousness fulfills their destiny within their respective timelines, and the miracle of your humanity is rendered ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.

Detachment from all derivative identities is the long path toward realization. These include outcomes, possessions, beliefs, pleasures, pains, desires, and the ego. Fortunately, opportunities to let go will arise constantly in day to day life, meaning you can consciously choose to align with the natural way of things.
