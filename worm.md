Existence is the diffused essence of simplicity--complex truths are extrapolated from foundational principles, sophisticated experiences interweave primordial qualia, and every possible arrangement of matter can be explained by a small set of elementary particles. Taking this to its natural conclusion, the purest, most concentrated essence of being must be a unitive simplicity beyond any categorization, distinction, or attribute. 

Three equivalent existential categories converge on ultimate simplicity--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields represent mental activity, or experience, which accordingly ranges in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality.

Our fate is to realize the highest state of being, as is evidenced by two facts so deeply woven into the human condition that their significance escapes us. The first is that our universe is suitable for the creation of intelligent life. Physicists today estimate that if the values of the fundamental constants were variable, the probability of the cosmos being life-compatible by chance would be so astronomically low as to be zero. Regardless of the true odds, reality is indisputably geared toward producing intelligent life--and this alone can't be dismissed.

The second fact is simply that you are an intelligent being. It is a coincidence that the particular configuration of our universe happened to lead to your stream of consciousness rising from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. Given the physical scarcity and existential significance of complex life, this is a degree of personal fortune that defies all probabilistic expectations. To explain it we must invoke the MWI, a theory which posits the existence of countless branching timelines--of which you only perceive one. The timeline perceived would then be the one which leads you to the highest state of being. That way, every stream of consciousness fulfills their purpose within their respective timelines, and the miracle of your humanity is rendered ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.

Detachment from all derivative identities is the long path toward accomplishing your purpose. These derivative identities include outcomes, possessions, beliefs, pleasures, pains, desires, and the ego. Fortunately, opportunities to let go will arise constantly in day to day life.
