The diffused essence of simplicity defines our existence--complex truths are extrapolated from foundational principles, sophisticated experiences interweave primordial qualia, and every possible configuration of matter can be explained by a small set of elementary particles. Taking this line of reasoning to its natural conclusion, the purest, most concentrated essence of being is thus a unitive simplicity beyond all categories, distinctions, and attributes. 

Three equivalent categories of being converge on ultimate simplicity--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields represent mental activity, or experience, which accordingly ranges in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is the truth, pattern, and order that structures reality.

To realize the highest state is our purpose, as is evidenced by two facts so immanent to the human condition that we struggle to recognize them. The first is that our universe is suitable for the creation of intelligent life. Physicists today estimate that if the values of the fundamental constants were variable, the probability of the cosmos being life-compatible by chance would be so astronomically low as to be zero. The second fact is simply that you are an intelligent being. Given physical scarcity of our kind among all forms of matter, the coincidence that your stream of consciousness rose from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness defies all statistical reason. A justification for your providence can be found in the MWI, a theory which posits the existence of countless branching timelines--of which you only perceive one. The timeline perceived must be the one which leads you to the highest state of being. That way, every mind fulfills their purpose within their respective timelines, and the miracle of your humanity is rendered ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.

Detatchment from all derivative identities is the long path toward accomplishing your purpose. These derivative identities include outcomes, possessions, beliefs, pleasures, pains, desires, and the ego. Fortunately, opportunities to let go will arise constantly in day to day life.
