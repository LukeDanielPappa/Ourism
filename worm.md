The variety and intricacy of our world is the diffused essence of simplicity. Consider how complex truths are extrapolated from foundational principles, sophisticated experiences interweave primordial qualia, and every possible array of matter is rooted in a small set of elementary particles. Working backwards, the quintessence of existence must therefore be a pure simplicity beyond all categories, distinctions, and attributes.

Three equivalent categories of being emerge from the ineffable--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields reflect mental activity, or experiences, which accordingly range in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in nature. Intelligibility is of course the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality.

One's fate is to know pure being, as is evidenced by two facts so deeply woven into the human condition that their significance escapes us. The first is that our universe is suitable for the creation of intelligent life. Physicists today estimate that if the values of the fundamental constants were variable, the probability of the cosmos being life-compatible by chance would be so astronomically low as to be zero. If there is one thing everyone can agree on, it's that we didn't just get lucky. However you account for it, the bottom line is that reality permits life--and the significance of this hits home.

This leads us into the second fact, which is simply that you are an intelligent life form. In other words, the particular physical configuration of our universe happened to elevate your stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. Given the corporeal scarcity and existential significance of higher-order minds, this is a degree of personal fortune that defies all probabilistic expectations. One plausible explanation for this phenomenon can be found in the MWI, a theory which posits the existence of countless branching timelines--of which you only perceive one. The timeline perceived would then be the one in which you come to know pure being. This way, every stream of consciousness realizes its full potential within its respective timeline, rendering the miracle of your humanity ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.

Detachment from all derivative identities is the long path toward realization. These include outcomes, possessions, beliefs, pleasures, pains, desires, and the ego. Fortunately, opportunities to let go will arise constantly in day to day life, meaning you can consciously choose to align with the natural way of things. Having advanced knowledge of your fate also helps in this regard.
