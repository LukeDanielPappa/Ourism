Existence comprises three equivalent categories of being--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Fluctuations in these fields correspond to mental activity, or experience, which accordingly ranges in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. intelligibility is the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality. 

Just as complex truths are extrapolated from foundational principles, sophisticated experiential states interweave primordial qualia, and intricate aggregates of matter are explained by a small set of elementary particles, the complexity and multiplicity of the world derives from a pure simplicity beyond all categories, distinctions, and attributes. 

Unification with the ground of being is the nature of existence.
