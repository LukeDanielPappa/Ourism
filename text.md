Ineffable, immediate reality is articulated as qualia, which are then formalized and systematized within science and philosophy. It may be inferred from those disciplines that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds, in turn, span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Personally being sapient is consequently such an improbable and significant privilege that it defies coincidence. To make sense of one's circumstances, then, it may be posited that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being--undifferentiated unity.

Awakening to the oneness of everything requires maturity. The foundation of maturity is the recognition that inflicting misery upon oneself--whether in reaction to external events, the actions of others, or even oneâ€™s own shortcomings--is never justified. To live in accordance with one's purpose thus necessitates a commitment to honoring this principle.
