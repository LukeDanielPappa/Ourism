Indescribable, immediate reality is interpreted as experience, and experience as occurrence. The disciplines of mysticism, philosophy, and physics systematize these modes of perception, trisecting unity into transcendent, abstract, and behavioral objects, respectively. Discrete sets of these objects constitute individuals, who rise and fall within existence like waves in a churning sea.

An individualâ€™s freedom of will entails many possible universes, of which they know only one. Specifically, they perceive the timeline in which they gain the cognitive ability to reflect upon themselves and thereby become conscious of their blissful, timeless, and undivided nature. Thus, at its most essential level, existence is a boundless and eternal act of self-realization.
