Compressing indescribable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize my grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. With that base of understanding, I can infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, of which I am one.

Streams, or souls, span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making my elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the likelihood of that happening to me is vanishingly small.

There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each soul perceives the world-branch in which they come to partake in the Divine nature.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid circular reasoning, it is necessary to posit an utterly transcendent ground of being—what may be called the Godhead. Moreover, this Godhead can be communed with as a transcendent Spirit that permeates existence, apprehended only through participation in a transcendent Logos, fully revealed in Christ. Jesus exemplified and taught the ultimate principle—unconditional love—revealing Him as the very heart of the Word, whose truth becomes self-evident to those graced to discern it.

The ethos of evil is the nihilistic pursuit of power, and consequently it despises love, humility, and the Divine. Those temporarily caught in its grasp will hate and persecute the followers of Christ, but the fact of the matter is that even the wicked deserve charity. This is the judgment of God.
