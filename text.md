I articulate myself as qualia, which I formalize and systematize. I am part of an ontologically coherent reality, comprising other discrete streams of experience, or minds.

Minds span in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The consequent rarity and significance of sapience makes the personal transformation from commonplace matter into a human being defy coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it reaches a perfected state of being.

Perfect being may be defined by a pure heart. Such a mind no longer inflicts misery upon itself in response to external events, the actions of others, and its own shortcomings.
