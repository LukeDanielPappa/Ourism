Ineffable, immediate reality is articulated as qualia, which are then formalized and systematized within science and philosophy. From those disciplines it may be gathered that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds therefore span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The rarity of sapient minds consequently makes personal sapience an unlikely privilege, to the extent of defying mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one may invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually becomes fully conscious of God's love.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid such circular reasoning, it is necessary to posit a fully transcendent ground of being--what may be called God. By this definition, God is above ontological categories, causality, and even the rules of logic. He is accordingly uncreated, unknowable, and wholly unrestrained in ability.

Much as truth is grasped by the intellect, the love of God is received by a pure heart. The simplest and most effective way to purify the heart is reciting the Jesus Prayer.
