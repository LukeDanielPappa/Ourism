Compressing indescribable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize my grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. With that base of understanding, I can infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, of which I am one.

Streams, or souls, span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making my elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the likelihood of that happening to me is vanishingly small.

There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each soul perceives the world-branch in which they come to know God fully. 

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid circular reasoning, it is necessary to posit a fully transcendent ground of being. From this silent nothingness proceed both logos and spirit, equally transcendent. United, the ground, the logos, and the spirit constitute a single realityâ€”what may be called God. To apprehend God, a soul must purify itself by practicing unconditional love for oneself and others.
