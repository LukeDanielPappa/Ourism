The self is ineffable, immediate reality. It is beyond words, beyond thought, and can only be known directly in the present moment. It is not something you can understand intellectually—it is what you are, right now, before you try to define it. If you do attempt analysis, you may call it experience. You may further interpret a subset of experience as the observation of patterned activity, and then systematize your grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. After building up all these layers of interpretation and understanding, you then start to identify with the content of those layers — and from that, create a personal identity, or ego. Your ego may then conceive of itself as one observer among many, recognizing itself and others as discrete excitations in a quantum field.

A given observer should not expect to experience life as a sapient organism, but as commonplace matter. And yet, one’s own circumstances flatly contradict this. In order to resolve this discrepancy we must invoke the Everett interpretation and posit that each observer perceives the world branch in which they become conscious of the self. Our universe then becomes an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization, as every single piece of it experiences that fate within their respective timelines. For example, a hydrogen ion in this timeline may have become a self-aware being in another, while inversely you likely remained a hydrogen ion in the infinite majority of timelines—but from the perspective of both observers they know only the timeline in which they attain self-realization.

It is highly advantageous to understand that everything happens for a reason and then also know what that reason is. Moreover, having the foreknowledge that you’re destined for the highest possible good affords the confidence and peace of mind necessary to bring it to fruition. It also helps to know that the root cause of your suffering is not undesirable circumstances or even your own behavior, but the fact that you inflict misery upon yourself because of these things. Make the choice to stop doing this when bad things inevitably happen to you and in time your ego will give way to the blissful, eternal, undivided, and unconditional love that is self-realization.
