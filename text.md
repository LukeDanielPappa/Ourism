Compressing ineffable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity and then systemize my grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. With that base of understanding I can infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, of which I am one.

A stream is a soul, whose nature is like that of a wave â€” it retains its identity despite slowly changing form and trading molecules over time. In my case, I was elevated from commonplace matter into sapience. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the likelihood of that happening to me is vanishingly small.

There is a point at which someone must consider if their luck can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human is a level of luck that far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each soul perceives the world branch in which they come to love God fully. 

God is the one responsible for this entire situation. He is over and above existence itself, making his potential and ability completely unrestricted by any conceivable limitation, definition, or framework. He is consequently unknowable, beyond not just comprehension but even the possibility of understanding. That said, I can sense his presence, and I know that he cares for me infinitely and wants me to embrace him with reciprocal intensity.

To realize my purpose, I must stop inflicting misery upon myself under undesirable conditions. This is the only path to blissful, timeless, undivided, and unconditional love. Providence will guide me.
