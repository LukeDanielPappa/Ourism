Compressing indescribable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize my grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. With that base of understanding, I can infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, of which I am one.

Streams span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making my elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the likelihood of that happening to me is vanishingly small.

There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each stream perceives the world-branch in which they achieve union with the Divine.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid circular reasoning, it is therefore necessary to posit a transcendent source of being—what may be called Divinity. By this definition, the Divine is over and above ontological categories, causality, and even the rules of logic. It is consequently unknowable, ineffable, and wholly unrestricted by any conceivable limitation, definition, or framework. 

Moreover, a stream can unknow into Divinity with a clear, unperturbed mind. The prerequisite to this kind of experience is thus the rejection of misery as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even one’s own shortcomings. Upon attainment of such clarity, the stream will come to realize that the Spirit and Logos of the Divine is a radiating, unconditional love.
