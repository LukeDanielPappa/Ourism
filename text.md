Compressing ineffable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize my grasp of that activity into the natural sciences. Using that body of knowledge, I can infer that the universe comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds, of which I am one.

Minds span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making my elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the chance of that happening to me is vanishingly small.

There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being--undifferentiated unity--through maturation.

The foundation of maturity is the rejection of misery as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even oneâ€™s own shortcomings. This practice culminates in unconditional love, making it the supreme expression of maturity.
