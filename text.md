The self is ineffable, immediate reality. It is beyond words, beyond thought, and can only be known directly in the present moment. It is not something you can understand intellectually—it is what you are, right now, before you try to define it. If you do, you may call it experience. You may then abstract patterned activity from experience, such as things like time or motion, which can then be formalized into what we call physics. After building up all these layers of interpretation and understanding, the self then starts to identify with the content of those layers — and from that, it creates a personal identity, or ego. The ego may then conceive of itself as one observer among many, recognizing itself and all others as discrete excitations of a quantum field.

The physical configuration of our universe was such that your stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter into a sapient organism. This is the case because each observer perceives the world branch in which they become conscious of the self. Our universe is an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization, as every single piece of it experiences that fate within their respective timelines.

As an aside, the root cause of your suffering is not undesirable conditions, but the fact that you inflict misery upon yourself because of them. Simply have the wherewithal to stop inflicting misery upon yourself when bad things inevitably happen to you and your ego will dissolve much more easily into the blissful, timeless, and undivided awareness of self-realization.
