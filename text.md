The self is ineffable, immediate reality. It may ascribe meaning to its existence, interpreting itself first as qualia, then abstracting those sensations into patterned activity—into what we call physics. Occupying these projected layers of intelligibility, it conjures an identity, or ego. The ego may see itself as one observer among many, a discrete excitation of an underlying field.

Reasoning as a randomly selected observer, one should expect to be typical—say, a hydrogen ion. And yet, the extreme opposite is the case. To resolve this discrepancy and thereby render sapient life ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected, the Everett interpretation must be invoked. Since a given observer can only perceive one timeline from the multiverse, it can be posited that each observer knows only the world branch in which they become conscious of the self. Our universe could then be seen as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization, as every single part of it subjectively experiences that fate.

As an aside, the root cause of your suffering is not unfavorable circumstances, but the fact that you inflict misery upon yourself because of them. Rebel against this instinct and your ego will dissolve into the blissful, timeless, and undivided awareness of self-realization.
