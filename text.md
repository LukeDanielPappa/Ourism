Ineffable, immediate reality is articulated as qualia, which are then formalized and systematized into disciplines such as science and philosophy. For existence to possess ontological coherence, it must then comprise discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds presumably span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The rarity of sapience consequently makes personally being sapient an unlikely privilege, to the extent of defying mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one may invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid such circular reasoning, it is therefore necessary to posit a transcendent source of being--what may be called God. By this definition, God is above properties, logic, and causality. He is consequently wholly unconstrained in essence and ability. Much as the intellect sees truth, the heart senses God's presence. It does so when it no longer inflicts misery upon itself.
