The self is ineffable, immediate reality. It may ascribe meaning to its existence, interpreting itself first as qualia, then abstracting those sensations into patterned activity—into what we call physics. Occupying these projected layers of intelligibility, it conjures an identity, or ego. The ego may see itself as one observer among many, a discrete excitation of an underlying field.

If you reason as a randomly selected observer, you should expect to be typical—say, a hydrogen ion. And yet, the extreme opposite is the case. To resolve this discrepancy and thereby render sapient life ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected, we must invoke the Everett interpretation. Since a given observer can only know one timeline from the multiverse, we can posit that each observer perceives a world branch in which they become conscious of the self. Existence would then become an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization.

When you fall short of your expectations, do not compound the problem by inflicting shame or guilt upon yourself. Do not turn an offense into suffering by inflicting anger upon yourself. Do not inflict yourself with grief, craving, or jealousy. Your ego will dissolve into the blissful, timeless, undivided awareness of self-realization only when self-imposed misery ceases.
