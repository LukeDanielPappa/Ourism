I may articulate myself as qualia, which I can then formalize and systematize into understanding. Assuming I am part of an ontologically monistic existence, it must comprise other discrete streams of experience, or minds.

Minds, then, span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The consequent rarity and significance of sapience makes personally acquiring it defy coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid such circular reasoning, it is therefore necessary to posit a transcendent source of being: God. By this definition, God is above properties, logic, and causality. He is accordingly wholly unconstrained in essence and ability. 

Much as the intellect sees truth, the heart senses God's presence. It does so after it no longer inflicts misery upon itself in response to external events, the actions of others, and its own shortcomings.
