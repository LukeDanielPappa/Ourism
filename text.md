Compressing ineffable, immediate reality into meaning, one may articulate themselves as experience. They may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize their grasp of that activity into the natural sciences. Using that body of knowledge, they may infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds, of which they are one.

Minds span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making one's elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To make sense of their circumstances, they may posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being--nondual love.

The rejection of misery as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even oneâ€™s own shortcomings culminates in awakening. To realize one's purpose, the maxim to live by is then this: do not inflict misery upon oneself.
