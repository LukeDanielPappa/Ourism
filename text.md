Ineffable, immediate reality is articulated as qualia. Qualia are then formalized and systematized into science and philosophy. It may be inferred from those disciplines that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds span in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. One's transition from commonplace matter to sapience is consequently such an impossibly rare and significant privilege that it defies mere coincidence. To make sense of their fortune, then, they must posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being--undifferentiated unity.

Awakening requires maturity. The foundation of maturity is the rejection of miserably as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even oneâ€™s own shortcomings. To live in accordance with purpose thus necessitates a commitment to this principle.
