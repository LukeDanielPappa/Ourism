Compressing indescribable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity and then systematize my grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. With that base of understanding, I can infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, of which I am one.

Streams span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making my elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the likelihood of that happening to me is vanishingly small.

There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each stream perceives the world-branch in which they become partakers in the Divine nature.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid circular reasoning, it is necessary to posit an utterly transcendent ground of being—what may be called the Godhead. Moreover, this Godhead is directly apprehended in the Holy Spirit, and this is made possible only through participation in the Logos, fully revealed in Christ. Until grace guides me to Him, I will remain like a child, kicking and screaming in the embrace of the Divine.

Virtue is the negation of misery in response to external events, the actions of others, and even one’s own shortcomings. Christ exemplified and taught the ultimate virtue—unconditional love—revealing it as the very heart of the Logos.
