Compressing ineffable, immediate reality into meaning, it may be articulated as qualia. Experience may then be formalized and systematized within science and philosophy, serving as the basis of our knowledge. From those disciplines it may be gathered that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds therefore span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The consequent distribution of cognitive ability makes personal sapience a rare and significant privilege, to the extent of defying mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one may invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually awakens to the fullness of being, which is unconditional love, or God.

Apprehending God requires maturity. The foundation of maturity is the recognition that inflicting misery upon oneself--whether in reaction to external events, the actions of others, or even oneâ€™s own shortcomings--is never justified. To live for God thus necessitates honoring this principle.
