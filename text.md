Compressing ineffable, immediate reality into meaning, one may articulate themselves as experience. They may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize their grasp of that activity into the natural sciences. Using that body of knowledge, they may infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds, of which they are one.

Minds span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making one's elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Such fortune crosses the threshold at which coincidence alone can no longer account for it, indicating that one's humanity must be explained by something beyond mere chance. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one may posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being, which is nondual love, or God.

By this definition, God is the absolutely simple, fully transcendent, fully immanent, and necessarily existent ground of being. To know Him, one must reject misery as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even their own shortcomings. The maxim to live by is thus as follows: do not inflict misery upon oneself.
