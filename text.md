Ineffable, immediate reality is articulated as qualia, which are then formalized and systematized within science and philosophy. It may be inferred from those disciplines that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. One's transition from commonplace matter to sapience is consequently such an impossibly rare and significant privilege that it defies mere coincidence. To make sense of their fortune, then, they must posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being--undifferentiated unity.

Awakening requires maturity. The foundation of maturity is the recognition that inflicting misery upon oneself--whether in reaction to external events, the actions of others, or oneâ€™s own shortcomings--is never justified. To live in accordance with one's purpose thus necessitates a commitment to honoring this principle.
