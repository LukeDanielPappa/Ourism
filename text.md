Ineffable, immediate reality may be articulated as experience. Qualia can then be reinterpreted as patterned activity and systematized into the natural sciences. Speaking in those terms, the universe comprises brains.

Brains span in complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems. One's transition from commonplace matter to sapience is consequently such an impossibly rare and significant privilege that it defies mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, they may posit that each brain perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being--undifferentiated unity.

Awakening requires a perfect maturity. The foundation of maturity is the rejection of miserably as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even oneâ€™s own shortcomings. To live in accordance with purpose thus necessitates a commitment to this principle.
