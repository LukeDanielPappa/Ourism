Ineffable, immediate reality is articulated as qualia, which are then formalized and systematized within science and philosophy. From those disciplines it may be gathered that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The rarity of sapient minds consequently makes personally being sapient an unlikely privilege, to the extent of defying mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one may invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it reaches full maturity.

Maturation begins with the recognition that misery is merely an inappropriate response to external events, the actions of others, or oneâ€™s own shortcomings--and it culminates in unconditional love, radical humility, inner peace, and a pure heart.
