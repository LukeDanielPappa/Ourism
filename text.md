Ineffable, immediate reality can be articulated as qualia. Qualia can be reinterpreted as patterned activity, which can then be systematized into the natural sciences. Drawing from them, one may infer that existence comprises discrete streams of qualia, or minds.

Minds would then span in complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems. One's experiential elevation from commonplace matter to sapience would consequently be such an impossibly rare and significant privilege that it would defy mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one may posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it awakens to the fullness of being--undifferentiated unity.

Recognizing the oneness of everything requires maturity. The foundation of maturity is the rejection of misery as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even oneâ€™s own shortcomings. To live in accordance with one's purpose therefore requires a commitment to this principle.
