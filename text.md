Ineffable, immediate reality is articulated as qualia, which are then formalized and systematized within science and philosophy. From those disciplines it may be gathered that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The rarity of sapient minds consequently makes personally being sapient an unlikely privilege, to the extent of defying mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one may invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid such circular reasoning, it is therefore necessary to posit a transcendent source of being--what may be called God. By this definition, God is above properties, logic, and causality. He is consequently uncreated, unknowable, and wholly unrestrained in ability.

Communion is supra-intellectual. It requires a pure heart, which is one that does not inflict misery upon itself--whether as a response to external events, the actions of others, and oneâ€™s own shortcomings.
