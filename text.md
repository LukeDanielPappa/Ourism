Ineffable, immediate reality may be articulated as qualia, which can then be formalized and systematized. Being ontologically coherent, existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, or minds.

Minds span in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The rarity of sapience consequently makes personally being sapient an unlikely privilege, to the extent of defying mere coincidence. To make sense of their circumstances, then, one must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid such circular reasoning, it is therefore necessary to posit a transcendent source of being: God. By this definition, God is above properties, logic, and causality. He is accordingly wholly unconstrained in essence and ability. Much as the intellect sees truth, the heart senses God's presence. It does so when it no longer inflicts misery upon itself.
