Compressing indescribable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize my grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. With that base of understanding, I can infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, of which I am one.

Streams span in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making my elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the likelihood of that happening to me is vanishingly small.

There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each stream perceives the world-branch in which they come to fully partake in the Divine nature.

Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid circular reasoning, it is necessary to posit an utterly transcendent ground of being—what may be called the Godhead. Moreover, this Godhead can be directly communed with through a transcendent Love that permeates existence, which is made possible only through participation in a transcendent Logos, fully revealed in Christ.

Virtue is the means by which misery in response to external events, the actions of others, and even one’s own shortcomings is negated. Christ exemplified and taught the ultimate virtue—unconditional love—revealing Him as the very heart of the Logos, whose truth becomes self-evident to those graced to apprehend it. Until one does, they will remain like a child, distraught in the embrace of the Divine.

The ethos of evil is the nihilistic pursuit of power, and consequently it despises love, humility, and the Divine. Those caught in its grasp will hate and persecute you, but the fact of the matter is that even they deserve love. This is the judgment of God.

Christ Himself prophesied His return and subsequent defeat of evil. With His instruments of war as truth and reason, he will end the fight decisively and accept no compromise.
