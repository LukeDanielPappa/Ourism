All souls possess four concentric natures, though the extent to which these natures are developed may vary. The outermost nature of the soul is the body, which represents physicality. This is everything  that can be observed, quantified, measured, and modeled. The inner nature of the body is the psyche, encompassing one's emotions, desires, sense-perceptions, volitions, and imagination. Moving further inwards is the intellect. This is the totality of one's thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures by which one interprets the psyche and makes sense of the body. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is the ineffable. There are many ways people have attempted to describe it--The One, The Godhead, Brahman, Nirvana, Tao, the ground of being, etc., but all of these descriptions ultimately fall short of the real thing.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never focus our attention on it. This isn't due to a lack of moral fiber or genius IQ, we just suck at focusing. Fortunately, there is a way to train one's attention on the ineffable and you already know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". Articulating exactly what that means is difficult, but you see athletes in the Olympics do it all the time. The tells are deep exhales, wiggling arms, and shifting feet. If done correctly, one of the first things that happens is a cessation of mental chatter. This lets you know you're on the right track. The idea is to collect yourself into a flow state, then surrender control and enter into a mystic experience, perceiving the ineffable heart of being. This takes practice, but the trick is getting yourself in the right mood. Outdoor activities where you receive an immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself, ritualizing the process. Regular mystical experiences do turn you into a better person and make life more tolerable, so doing all this is definitely worthwhile.


We all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize the "highest" state of being, since that would render your existential circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also considering the fact that you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unexplained element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that maybe you're fated to reach the mystic state--possibly for an indefinite period of time. If this is actually the case, then the cosmos could be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization. That should bring some comfort.
