A human being comprises four concentric natures. The outermost nature is the physical body. Being corporeal, it is observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable. The inner nature of the body is the psyche. The psyche represents experiences such as emotions, senses, volitions, memories, and dreams. The inner nature of the psyche is the intellect. This is the totality of our thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandingsâ€”the structures by which we interpret experience and make sense of the world. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is the ineffable. There are various ways to describe it, but generally it is seen as a timeless, blissful, mystical nothingness. This structure of natures is present to a greater or lesser extent in everything, not just humans.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never focus our attention on it. This isn't because it requires moral purification or a genius IQ, we just suck at it. Fortunately, there is a way to train one's attention on the ineffable and you already know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". You see athletes in the Olympics do it all the time. Its hard to explain exactly how to do it, but the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, and maybe shifting feet. If you do it right one of the first things that happens is that the chatter in your mind subsides. This lets you know your on the right track. The idea is to get into a flow state, and then surrender control and enter into a mystical experience. This takes practice, but the trick is getting yourself in the mood to actually do it. Outdoor activities where you receive an immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself, turning it almost into a Pavlovian response. Regular mystical experiences do make you a better person and life tolerable, so it's definitely worth it.


We all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize some "highest" state of being, since that would render your existential circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also factoring in the fact you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unexplained element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that maybe you're meant to enjoy the mystic state indefinitely, which should be some encouragement.
