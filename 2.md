Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, undivided heart of being. A "mystical experience" occurs when attention is fully trained upon it.


Before an event, olympic athletes will "collect themselves"--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. Being able to do this effectively is essential for athletic performance--and for generating the mystic state. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on this inner silence. Nothing is going to happen right away, but do this consistently and for extended periods of time and thinks will start to click. The key is collecting yourself in an environment with little to no distractions, as this makes it much easier for awareness itself to take center stage.

 

We assume that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize a mystic state, since that would render your impossibly fortunate circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also considering the fact that you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unusual element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that attaining the mystic state is most likely the function of existence and the permanent fate of every individual. This being the case, the cosmos can be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization.
