A human being comprises four concentric natures. The outermost nature is the physical body. Being corporeal, it is able to be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. The inner nature of the body is the psyche. The psyche represents experiences such as emotions, senses, volitions, memories, and dreams. The inner nature of the psyche is the intellect. This is the totality of our thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandingsâ€”the structures by which we interpret experience and make sense of the world. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is the ineffable. There are various ways to describe it, but generally it is seen as a timeless, blissful, mystical nothingness. This structure of natures is present not just in a human being, but to a greater or lesser degree in everything.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never focus our attention on it. This isn't because it requires moral purification or a high IQ, we just suck at it. Fortunately, there is a way to train one's attention on the ineffable, and you already know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". You see athletes in the Olympics do it all the time. Its hard to explain exactly how to do it, but the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, and maybe shifting feet. If you do it right one of the first things that happens is that the chatter in your mind subsides. This lets you know your on the right track. The idea is to get into a flow state, and then surrender control and enter into a mystical experience. The trick is to get yourself in the mood to do this. Outdoor activities where you receive an immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself, turning it almost into a Pavlovian response. Regular mystical experiences do make you a better person and life tolerable, so it's definitely worth it.
