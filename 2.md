A human being comprises four concentric natures. The outermost nature is corporeal, meaning it is observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable. The inner nature of the body is the psyche. The psyche encompasses emotion, desire, sense-perception, volition, and imagination. Moving further inwards is the intellect. This is the totality of one's thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures by which one interprets the psyche and makes sense of the world. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is the ineffable. There are many ways people have attempted to describe it--The One, The Godhead, Brahman, Nirvana, Tao, the ground of being, etc. All of these names ultimately fall short and are of course no substitute for direct knowledge. These four natures are present to a greater or lesser extent in everything, not just us.

Our innermost nature is always there, but we almost never focus our attention on it. This isn't due to a lack of moral fiber or genius IQ, we just suck at focusing. Fortunately, there is a way to train one's attention on the ineffable and you already know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". Articulating exactly what that means is difficult, but you see athletes in the Olympics do it all the time. The tells are deep exhales, wiggling arms, and shifting feet. If done correctly, one of the first things that happens is a cessation of mental chatter. This lets you know your on the right track. The idea is to get yourself into a flow state and then surrender control and enter into a mystical state, perceiving the ineffable heart of being. This takes practice, but the trick is getting yourself in the right mood. Outdoor activities where you receive an immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself, ritualizing the process. Regular mystical experiences do make you a better person and life tolerable, so it's definitely worthwhile.


We all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize the "highest" state of being, since that would render your existential circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also factoring in the fact you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unexplained element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that maybe you're fated to reach the mystic state--possibly indefinitely into the future. That should serve as some comfort.
