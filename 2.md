The world as we ordinarily perceive it can be described as the diffused light of something called the Monad--a pure simplicity prior to categories, distinctions, and attributes. As the source of illumination, the Monad alone possesses concrete existence, with the apparent complexity and multiplicity of the world being mere projections. To illustrate this point, consider how sophisticated theorems are derived from basic axioms, how rich experiences interweave primordial qualia, and how every possible configuration of matter is rooted in a small set of elementary particles. In each of these cases, simplicity serves as the ontological basis for more advanced aspects of reality. Working backwards, we can infer that the Monad is the ground of being.

To be more precise, the Monad is the ground of behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields reflect mental activity, or experiences, which accordingly range in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is of course the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality. In this way, what is behavioral is simultaneously experiential and intelligible, and what is experiential is also intelligible and behavioral, and so on.

We all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize some "highest" state of being, since that would render one's existential circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also factoring in the fact you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unexplained element of fine-tuning in your life.

Union with the Monad seems to be the only cadidate for full actualization. This would be achieved through complete mental detachment from derivative identities, such as outcomes, possessions, desires, beliefs, pleasures, pains, the ego, and even pure being itself. The point is not to remove these things from your life, but simply to stop clinging to them. Doing so should provide you with a direct experience of the Monad, ultimate reality, pure being, nonduality, etc. You can consciously work towards complete detachment or be dragged there by fate--the choice is yours to make.
