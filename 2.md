A human being is composed of four concentric natures. The outermost nature is the physical body. Being corporeal, it is able to be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. The inner nature of the body is the psyche. The psyche represents experiences such as emotions, senses, volitions, memories, and dreams. The inner nature of the psyche is the intellect. This is the totality of our thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandingsâ€”the structures by which we interpret experience and make sense of the world. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is the ineffable. There are various ways to describe it, but generally it is seen as an eternal, blissful nothingness. This structure of natures is present to a greater or lesser degree in everything.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never focus our attention on it. This isn't because it requires moral purification or a high IQ, we just suck at it. Fortunately, there is a way to train one's attention on the ineffable, and you already know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". You see athletes in the Olympics do it. They take a deep breath, shake their arms a little, and maybe shift their feet. If you do it right one of the first things that happen is that the chatter in your mind subsides. If that happens then you know your on the right track. The idea is to get into a flow state, and then from there relinquish control and enter into a mystical experience. The trick is to get yourself in the mood to do this. Outdoor activities where you receive immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself and its become almost a Pavlovian response.


 The idea is to first reach a flow state, and then from there transition into a full mystical experience. The easiest way to do this is to do some kind of outdoor activity.


The best way to do some kind of outdoor activity in nature.



st effective method is simply to "collect yourself". It's hard to describe exactly what this means, but everyone can grasp it intuitively. It entails a little wrist shake, a deep breath in, maybe shifting your feet. Your trying to get into a flow state. 

It's the kind of things you see professional athletes do all the time. For our purposes, this works best in nature, where there is a lot of stimulus.
