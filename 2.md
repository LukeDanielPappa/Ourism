You comprise four concentric natures. The outermost nature of your being is the body. This is your physical presence in the world, making it observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable. The inner nature of the body is the psyche, encompassing your emotions, desires, sense-perceptions, volitions, memories, and mental images. The psyche may lack the qualities of the body, but it is nevertheless more fundamental to who you are. Moving further inwards is the intellect. This is the totality of your thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures by which you interpret the psyche and make sense of the body. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is awareness. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, nondual heart of being. 

This structure of natures does not just define you, but everyone and everything. Even in the most extreme case, a lone particle still possesses some miniscule degree of body, psyche, intellect, and awareness. This is not to say that all aggregates of matter posess the single, cohesive consciousness demonstrated by biological organisms.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never train our full attention on it. This isn't because we lack moral fiber or a genius IQ, but because we just suck at focusing. Fortunately, there is a way to experience pure awareness and you already intuitively know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". You see athletes in the Olympics do it all the time--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. If done correctly, one of the first things that happens is a cessation of mental chatter. All that's left is to train your focus on this inner silence. With enought time and effort, eventually things will click. The trick is getting yourself in the right mood. Outdoor activities where you receive an immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself, ritualizing the process. Once you get the hang of it you can do it anywhere. Regular "mystical experiences" do turn you into a better person and make life more tolerable, so trying all of this is definitely worthwhile. In fact, some even consider the mystic state to be the goal of life itself.

We all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize the "highest" state of being, since that would render your existential circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also considering the fact that you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unusual element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that maybe you're fated to reach the mystic state--possibly for an indefinite period of time. If this is actually the case, then the cosmos could be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization. That should bring some comfort.
