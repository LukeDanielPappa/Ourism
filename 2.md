A human being is composed of four concentric natures. The outermost nature is the physical body. Being corporeal, it is able to be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. The inner nature of the body is the psyche. The psyche represents experiences such as emotions, senses, volitions, memories, and dreams. The inner nature of the psyche is the intellect. This is the totality of our thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandingsâ€”the structures by which we interpret experience and make sense of the world. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is the ineffable. There are various ways to describe it, but generally it is seen as an eternal, blissful nothingness. This structure of natures is present to a greater or lesser degree in everything.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never focus our attention on it. This isn't because it requires moral purification or a high IQ, we just suck at it. Fortunately, there are ways to train one's attention on the ineffable. The idea is to first reach a flow state, and then from there transition into a full mystical experience. The easiest way to do this is to do some kind of outdoor activity.


The best way to do some kind of outdoor activity in nature.



st effective method is simply to "collect yourself". It's hard to describe exactly what this means, but everyone can grasp it intuitively. It entails a little wrist shake, a deep breath in, maybe shifting your feet. Your trying to get into a flow state. 

It's the kind of things you see professional athletes do all the time. For our purposes, this works best in nature, where there is a lot of stimulus.
