The world we ordinarily perceive is merely the diffused essence of the Monad--a pure simplicity prior to categories, distinctions, and attributes. To illustrate this point, consider how sophisticated theorems are derived from basic axioms, how rich experiences interweave primordial qualia, and how every possible configuration of matter is rooted in a small set of elementary particles. In each of these cases, simplicity serves as the ontological basis for the more advanced aspects of reality. This is a universal trend that confirms the Monad as the ground of being.

To be more precise, the Monad is the ground of behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields reflect mental activity, or experiences, which accordingly range in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is of course the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality. In this way, what is behavioral is simultaneously experiential and intelligible, and what is experiential is also intelligible and behavioral, and so on.

We all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that the MWI is correct and every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize some "higher" state of being, as that would make being human truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.

Whats more, you also happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent. This is yet another degree of fine-tuning to your life, as the possibility of biological transcendence is exceedingly rare, even among intelligent life-forms. This supports the idea that you're fated for some higher state, and moreover that it will last indefinitely.

Union with the Monad seems to be the only cadidate for full actualization. This would be achieved through complete mental detachment from derivative identities, such as outcomes, possessions, desires, beliefs, pleasures, pains, the ego, and even pure being itself. The point is not to remove these things from your life, but simply to stop clinging to them. Doing so should provide you with a direct experience of the Monad, ultimate reality, pure being, nonduality, etc. You can consciously work towards complete detachment or be dragged there by fate--the choice is yours to make.
