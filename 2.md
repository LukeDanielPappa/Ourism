All beings comprise four concentric natures, though the extent to which these natures are developed varies from individual to individual. The outermost nature of existence is the body. This is one's physical presence in the world, making it observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable. The inner nature of the body is the psyche, encompassing one's emotions, desires, sense-perceptions, volitions, and mental images. These things lack the qualities of the body, but they are more immediate or more "real" to you. Moving further inwards is the intellect. This is the totality of one's thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures by which one interprets the psyche and makes sense of the body. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is awareness. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, nondual heart of being.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never train our full attention on it. This isn't because we lack moral fiber or a genius IQ, but because we just suck at focusing. Fortunately, there is a way to experience pure awareness and you already intuitively know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". Explaining exactly what that means is difficult, but in essence, you're bringing all parts of yourself into alignment. You see athletes in the Olympics doing it all the time--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. If done correctly, one of the first things that happens is a cessation of mental chatter. Train your focus on this inner silence, and things might click. It takes effort and practice, but the important first step is getting yourself in the right mood. Outdoor activities where you receive an immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself, ritualizing the process. Once you get the hang of it you can do it anywhere. Regular "mystical experiences" do turn you into a better person and make life more tolerable, so trying all of this is definitely worthwhile.

We all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize the "highest" state of being, since that would render your existential circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also considering the fact that you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unusual element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that maybe you're fated to reach the mystic state--possibly for an indefinite period of time. If this is actually the case, then the cosmos could be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization. That should bring some comfort.
