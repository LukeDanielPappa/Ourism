Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. On the rare occasions when someone trains their full attention on it, they report something called a "mystical experience". These exist on a spectrum, but even weak mystic states turn one into a better person and make life more bearable. From here, pure awareness condenses into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which form the intellect.
