Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. It is always present, but we almost never bring our full attention to it. On the rare occasions when someone does, they report something called a "mystical experience". These range in intensity, but even mild mystic states make one a better person and improve the quality of their lives.


Arising from it are thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which form the intellect.
