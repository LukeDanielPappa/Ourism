Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. On the rare occasions when someone trains their full attention on it, they report something called a "mystical experience". These exist on a spectrum, but even weak mystic states turn one into a better person and make life more tolerable. From here, pure awareness condenses to form thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which constitute the intellect. The intellect can't make intelligible sense of mystic states precisely because they are ontologically prior to it. Instead, the intellect serves to interpret and make sense of the more condensed layers of awareness below it. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses all emotions, desires, volitions, sense perceptions, mental images, and memories. Awareness then condenses a final time to form the body. The body is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. It is essentially the physical presence of an individual.
