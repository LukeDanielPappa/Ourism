The particular physical configuration of our universe happened to elevate your personal stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. The odds of this being coincidental are equivalent to the ratio of the matter composing higher-order lifeforms to the matter constituting the rest of the universe. Obviously, the extremety of those odds completely rules out coincidence. So that leaves us with the "Fine Life Problem"--the task of justifying your existential privilege.

The Many Worlds Interpretation holds that reality is a branching tree of possible timelines--of which you only perceive one. If we believe that the timeline which and individual perceives is not random, but instead the one in which they reach some "highest state of being", then the FLP is solved. Your circumstances are rendered ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected within the context of the multiverse.

To define the highest state of being, the metaphysical structure of existence must first be understood. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. On the rare occasions when someone trains their full attention on it, they have something called a "mystical experience". Pure awareness condenses to form thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which constitute the intellect. The intellect can't make intelligible sense of mystic states precisely because they are ontologically prior to it. Instead, the intellect serves to interpret and make sense of the more condensed layers of awareness below it. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses all emotions, desires, volitions, sense perceptions, mental images, and memories. Awareness then condenses a final time to form the body. The body is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. It is essentially physical presence.

The mystic state is the highest form of being, and throughout history it has been given names like the One, the Good, Brahman, Nirvana, Moksha, the Tao, the Absolute, the Godhead, Ain Soph, the Void, the Kingdom of Heaven, and Pure Consciousness.
