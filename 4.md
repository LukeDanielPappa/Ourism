You could have come into existence as anything. The prior configuration of our deterministic universe just happened to elevate your personal stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. The odds of something like this being the case are equivalent to the ratio of the matter composing higher-order minds to the matter constituting the rest of the universe. Obviously, the extremity of those odds rules out fortunate coincidence as a reasonable justification for your circumstances. What's more, you are living in the era of the technological singularity, meaning you have the potential to advance well beyond your natural biological limitations. Even among intelligent organisms, this is an exceedingly rare privilege. So that leaves us with the "Fine Life Problem"--the task of rationalizing your near-maximal existential vantage.

The Many Worlds Interpretation holds that reality is a branching tree of possible timelines--of which you only perceive one. If we believe that the timeline which an individual perceives is not random, but instead the one in which they reach some "ideal" state, then the FLP is pretty much solved. Your situation is rendered ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected within the context of the multiverse.

Metaphysics would help to illuminate what an ideal state may look like. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided heart of being. On the rare occasions when someone trains their full attention on it, they have something called a "mystical experience". From here, pure awareness dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which make up the intellect. The intellect can't form an adequate comprehension of mystic states precisely because they are ontologically prior to it. Instead, the intellect serves to interpret and make sense of itself and the more diffuse layers of awareness below it. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses all desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions. Awareness then completely diminishes as the psyche transitions into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable behavior. All of these layers exist simultaneously and to varying degrees of local complexity.

The mystic state is the only candidate for our fated ideal state, and throughout history it has been given names--or understood as union with things called--the One, the Good, Brahman, Nirvana, Moksha, the Tao, the Absolute, the Godhead, Ain Soph, the Void, the Kingdom of Heaven, Pure Consciousness, Pure Being, etc. My personal favorite is simply "self-realization". Whatever name you give it, it refers to that beyond which nothing greater can be conceived. Via biotechnological enhancements, you may even be destined to experience it forever. 

Before an event, olympic athletes will "collect themselves"--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, shifting feet, and a steady gaze. Being able to do this effectively is essential for athletic performance--and for generating the mystic state. Collecting yourself is something that everyone intuitively understands, and so it shouldn't need to be explained. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on that inner silence. Do this, and with enough time and repetition you will attain self-realization.

Mystical experiences will make you a better person and improve the quality of your life, but having advanced knowledge of your fate affords additional benefits. For one, living with the certainty that things will work out in the end makes dealing with the challenges of life a whole lot more manageable. It's easier to put problems into perspective, and in general, everything is made less stressful. It also offers a strong sense of purpose and hope, fueling your passions and staving off negativity and despair. The dark side to all of this is that you don't know the fate of others within your timeline. Even if the solution to the FLP is correct, you would essentially be selling false hope if you shared your knowledge with other people. The only real workaround to this would be a collective merging of consciousnesses into a single entity. This could only take place in the far future with advanced technology, but as long as you are a part of it then your fate will be shared with others.

To summarize everything as succinctly as possible, the universe can be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization.
