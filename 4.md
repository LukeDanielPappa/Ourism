We assume that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected, but the truth is that the particular physical configuration of our universe just happened to elevate your personal stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. The odds of this happening to you are equivalent to the ratio of the matter composing higher-order lifeforms to the matter constituting the rest of the universe. Obviously, the extremety of those odds completely rules out coincidence. So that leaves us with the "Fine Life Problem"--the task of justifying your existential privilege.

The Many Worlds Interpretation holds that reality is a branching tree of possible timelines--of which you only perceive one. If we believe that the timeline which and individual perceives is not random, but instead the one in which they reach some "highest state of being", then the FLP is solved. Your circumstances are rendered ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected within the context of the multiverse.

To define the highest state of being, the metaphysical structure of reality must first be understood. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. On the rare occasions when someone trains their full attention on it, they have something called a "mystical experience". Pure awareness condenses to form thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which constitute the intellect. The intellect can't form an adequate comprehension of mystic states precisely because they are ontologically prior to it. Instead, the intellect serves to interpret and make sense of the more condensed layers of awareness below it. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses all emotions, desires, volitions, sense perceptions, mental images, and memories. After the psyche, the final condensation of awareness is behavior. This is the outwardly observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable nature of being itself. It is essentially our physical presence.

The mystic state is the highest form of being, and throughout history it has been given names--or understood as union with things called--the One, the Good, Brahman, Nirvana, Moksha, the Tao, the Absolute, the Godhead, Ain Soph, the Void, the Kingdom of Heaven, and Pure Consciousness. Whatever name you give it, it refers to that beyond which nothing greater can be conceived.

Before an event, olympic athletes will "collect themselves"--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. Being able to do this effectively is essential for athletic performance--and for generating the mystic state. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on this inner silence. Nothing is going to happen right away, but do this consistently and for extended periods of time and things will start to click.


There are several key benefits to having advanced knowledge of your fate. 



In short, the universe can be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization.
