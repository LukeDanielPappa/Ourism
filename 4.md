You could have come into existence as anything. The prior configuration of our deterministic universe just happened to elevate your personal stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. The odds of something like this being the case are equivalent to the ratio of the matter composing higher-order minds to the matter constituting the rest of the universe. Obviously, the extremity of those odds rules out fortunate coincidence as a reasonable justification for your circumstances. What's more, you are living in the era of the technological singularity, meaning you have the potential to advance well beyond your natural biological limitations. Even among intelligent organisms, this is a exceedingly rare privilege. So that leaves us with the "Fine Life Problem"--the task of rationalizing your near-maximal existential vantage.

The Many Worlds Interpretation holds that reality is a branching tree of possible timelines--of which you only perceive one. If we believe that the timeline which an individual perceives is not random, but instead the one in which they reach some "ideal" state, then the FLP is pretty much solved. Your situation is rendered ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected within the context of the multiverse.

To define ideal, a quick lesson in metaphysics would help. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. On the rare occasions when someone trains their full attention on it, they have something called a "mystical experience". From here, pure awareness condenses to form thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which make up the intellect. The intellect can't form an adequate comprehension of mystic states precisely because they are ontologically prior to it. Instead, the intellect serves to interpret and make sense of itself and the more condensed layers of awareness below it. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses all emotions, desires, volitions, sense perceptions, mental images, and memories. The psyche then condenses awareness into its final and most concrete expression: behavior. This is the outwardly observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable nature of being itself. By definition, it is our physical presence. All of these layers exist simultaneously and to varying degrees of local complexity.

The mystic state is the only candidate for our ideal fate, and throughout history it has been given names--or understood as union with things called--the One, the Good, Brahman, Nirvana, Moksha, the Tao, the Absolute, the Godhead, Ain Soph, the Void, the Kingdom of Heaven, Pure Consciousness, Pure Being, etc. My personal favorite is simply "self-realization". Whatever name you give it, it refers to that beyond which nothing greater can be conceived. Via biotechnological enhancements, you may even be destined to experience it forever. 

Before an event, olympic athletes will "collect themselves"--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. Being able to do this effectively is essential for athletic performance--and for generating the mystic state. Collecting yourself is something that everyone intuitively understands. It doesn't need to be taught. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on this inner silence. Nothing is going to happen right away, but do this consistently and for extended periods of time and things will start to click.

Mystic states alone turn you into a better person and improve the quality of your life, but having advanced knowledge of your fate offers a few key benefits. For one, living with the certainty that things will work out in the end makes dealing with the challenges of life a whole lot more manageable. It's easier to put problems into perspective, and in general, everything is made less stressful. It also offers a strong sense of purpose and hope, fueling your efforts and staving off nihilistic urges. The dark side to all of this is that you don't know the fate of others within your timeline. Even if the solution to the FLP is correct, you would essentially be selling false hope if you shared your knowledge with other people. However, I view the promise of an unevidenced afterlife to be equally if not more unethical, so I am fine with playing on the level of already established doctrines. 

To summarize everything as succinctly as possible, the universe can be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization.
