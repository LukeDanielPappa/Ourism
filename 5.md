Ouric metaphysics asserts that a conscious entity only experiences the timeline in which they attain self-realization. The "self" is the blissful, timeless, and undivided pure awareness at the heart of being, and training one's full attention on it constitutes realization. Your own humanity evidences a mechanism of fate, as the elevation of your stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the highest levels of cognition is such an unthinkably rare privilege that it could not possibly be ascribed to luck.

Pure awareness dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of the intellect. As a derivative expression of fundamental reality, the intellect cannot form an adequate comprehension of its own source. Instead, it serves to interpret and make sense of itself and the more diffuse layers of awareness below it. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses desire, emotion, passion, volition, sense perception, and sense imagination. It is not as core to your being as pure awareness or the intellect, but it is nonetheless a critical component to identity. Awareness then completely diminishes as the psyche transitions into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable behavior. The behaviors or "physics" of our world are what is studied by the hard sciences. This chain of being is present to a greater or lesser extent in everything from lone particles to entire nervous systems.

Olympians will collect themselves before an event--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, shifting feet, and a steady gaze. This ritual is essential for athletic performance--and for self-realization. Done correctly, one of the first things you will experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on that inner silence. With enough time and practice you will achieve mastery over your mind.

Both self-realization and advanced knowledge of your fate will make you a better person and improve the quality of your life. The certainty that things will work out in the end makes dealing with the challenges of life a whole lot more manageable. It's easier to put problems into perspective, and everything in general is made less stressful. It also generates a strong sense of purpose and hope, fueling your passions and staving off negativity and despair. The dark side to this is that you don't know the fate of others within your timeline. You would essentially be selling false hope if you introduced Ourism to other people. The only real solution to this would be a collective merging of consciousnesses. This could only take place in the far future with advanced technology, but as long as you are a part of it then your fate can be shared with others. Until then, nothing can be guaranteed to them.
