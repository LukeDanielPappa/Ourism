Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. It dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of the intellect. Intellect dissipates into the psyche's desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions. Finally, awareness is dissipates completely into outwardly observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.
