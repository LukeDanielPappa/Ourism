Ouric philosophy holds that the function of existence and the fate of every individual is self-realization. The "self" is the blissful, timeless, and undivided pure awareness at the heart of being, and training one's full awareness on it accomplishes realization. The mechanism of fate is simply that every stream of consciousness perceives only the timeline in which they reach this highest state of being. This is evidenced by your very humanity, as the existential privilege of human awareness is such a rare phenomenon that fortune alone could not account for it.
