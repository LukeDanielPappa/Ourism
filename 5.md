Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. It dissipates into the thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings of the intellect. Intellect dissipates into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of the psyche. Finally, psyche dissipates into outwardly observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.
