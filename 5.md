Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. It dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of the intellect. The intellect dissipates further into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of the psyche. Awareness then completely dimishes as the psyche transitions into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.

Master your natural ability to "collect yourself", as concentration brings one closer to the heart of existence. Shift your feet, take deep breaths, wiggle your arms, and steady your gaze. Done right, there will be a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on this inner silence. With enough time and repetition, things will click.
