Ouric dogma asserts that an individual only perceives the timeline in which they attain self-realization. The "self" is the blissful, eternal, and undivided pure awareness at the heart of being, and training one's full attention on it constitutes realization. Your own humanity evidences a mechanism of fate, as the elevation of your stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the highest levels of cognition is such an unthinkably rare privilege that it can't be ascribed to chance.

Pure awareness dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of intellect. A true grasp of pure awareness escapes its derivative expression, as the intellect cannot comprehend that which lies prior to comprehension. Rather, it serves to interpret and make sense of itself and the diminished layers of awareness below. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses desire, emotion, passion, volition, sense perception, and sense imagination. Awareness completely dissolves as the psyche forms into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable behaviors or "physics". It's this most deprived level of awareness which falls within the domain of the hard sciences. To a greater or lesser extent, everything from individual particles to entire nervous systems comprise these four layers of being.

Olympians will "collect themselves" before an event--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, shifting feet, and a steady gaze. This ritual is essential for athletic performance--and for self-realization. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on that inner silence. The more practice you have with this, the more mastery you'll achieve over your attention.

Both self-realization and advanced knowledge of your fate will make you a better person and improve the quality of your life. The certainty that things will work out in the end makes dealing with everyday challenges a whole lot easier. It also generates a strong sense of purpose and hope, fueling your passions and staving off negativity and despair. The dark side to this is that you don't know the fate of others within your timeline. You'd essentially be selling false hope if you introduced Ourism to other people. The only real solution to this would be a collective merging of consciousnesses. This would require advanced bioengineering, most likely carried out by artificial intelligences--but as long as you're a part of it, your fate can be shared with others. Until then, nothing can be guaranteed to them.
