Ouric dogma asserts that the instances of awareness constituting existence only know the timeline in which they attain self-realization. The "self" is the blissful, eternal, and undivided pure awareness at the heart of being, and training one's full attention on it is the act of realization. Your own humanity evidences a mechanism of perceptual selection, as the elevation of your individual stream of consciousness--out of all others--to the highest levels of cognition is such an unthinkably rare privilege that it can't be ascribed to chance. The existence of multiple timelines is corroborated by the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, which affirms that while countless timelines may exist, you can only perceive one.

Pure awareness gives rise to thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings as its emanatory expressions. Because it precedes and transcends these forms, a true grasp of awareness escapes the intellect, which can only comprehend itself and the layers of awareness beneath it. This pattern of emanatory expression continues as the intellect unfolds into psyche--comprising desire, emotion, passion, volition, and sense imagery--and from there into behavior. At this outermost level, awareness is least apparent, and its expression becomes observable, measurable, and predictable: the domain of physics and the hard sciences.

To illustrate all of this with an example, say you had a pen in your hand. The pen, from the perspective of your instance of awareness, exists as neural activity. This activity is merely the emanatory expression of the psyche, specifically sense imagery. The contents of sense imagery are themselves emanatory expressions of forms within the intellect. In this case, an instantiation of the form "pen". Finally, the form is itself derived by pure awareness.

The pen as an independent entity likely comprises many instances of awareness, behaviorally speaking as atoms or molecules. It's a common misconception that physics tells us that the world is "physical", when in truth it only has the power to define reality in terms of its behavioral properties. The process which combines instances of awareness together is little understood, which is why the caveat of "likely comprises many instances" is added. Hopefully, this area of knowledge will grow with more research. Selecting a particular molecule from this pen, it also possess its own kind of severely limited, almost nonexistent, chain of awareness. Molecules such as this one are actually the extent of awareness in the universe, save for a few organisms scattered throughout the cosmos. Again, most likely.

Olympic athletes will "collect themselves" before an event--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, shifting feet, and a steady gaze. This ritual is essential for athletic performance--and for self-realization. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on that inner silence. The more practice you have with this, the more mastery you'll achieve over your attention. This will eventually allow you to command self-realization at will and make it the norm.

Both self-realization and advanced knowledge of your fate will make you a better person and improve the quality of your life. The certainty that things will work out in the end makes dealing with everyday challenges a whole lot easier. It also generates a strong sense of purpose and hope, fueling your passions and staving off negativity and despair. The dark side to this is that you don't know the fate of others within your timeline. You'd essentially be selling false hope if you introduced Ourism to other people. The only real solution to this would be a collective merging of consciousnesses. This would require advanced bioengineering, most likely concieved by artificial intelligences--but as long as you're a part of it, your fate can be shared with others. Until something like that happens, nothing can be guaranteed to them.
