Ouric philosophy holds that the function of existence and the fate of every individual is self-realization. The "self" is the blissful, timeless, and undivided pure awareness at the heart of being, and training one's full awareness on it is the act of realization. The mechanism behind fate is simply that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they reach this highest state of being. This is evidenced by your very humanity, as your elevation from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness defies all probabilistic expectations.

Pure awareness dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures which make up the intellect. The intellect can't form an adequate comprehension of mystic states precisely because they are ontologically prior to it. Instead, the intellect serves to interpret and make sense of itself and the more diffuse layers of awareness below it. The first of these is the psyche, which encompasses all desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions. Awareness then completely diminishes as the psyche transitions into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable behavior. All of these layers of awareness exist simultaneously and to varying degrees of local complexity.
