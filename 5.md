Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. It dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings of the intellect. Intellect dissipates into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of the psyche. Finally, awareness dissipates completely into outwardly observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.
