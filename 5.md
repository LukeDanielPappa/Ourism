Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided heart of being. Its essence dissipates into the thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings of the intellect. Intellect then dissipates further into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of the psyche. Finally, awareness is dissipated completely as the psyche transitions into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.
