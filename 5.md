Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. Its dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of the intellect. The intellect then dissipates further into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of the psyche. Finally, awareness is dissipated completely as the psyche transitions into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.

Concentration is the way to pure awareness.
