Awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. It dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of intellect. From there, intellect dissipates into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of psyche. Finally, awareness is dissipated completely into outwardly observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.
