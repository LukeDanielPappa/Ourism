Awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. It diffuses into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of intellect. From here, the intellect diffuses into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of psyche. Psyche diffuses into outwardly observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.
