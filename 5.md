Ouric dogma asserts that the instances of awareness which constitute existence only know the timeline in which they attain self-realization. The "self" is the blissful, eternal, and undivided pure awareness at the heart of being, and training one's full attention on it is the act of realization. Your own humanity evidences a mechanism of perceptual selection, as the elevation of your personal stream of consciousness above all others to the highest levels of cognition is such an unthinkably rare privilege that it defies attribution to chance.

Pure awareness gives rise to thoughts, ideas, concepts, archetypes, beliefs, and understandings as its emanatory expressions. Because it precedes and transcends these forms, a true grasp of awareness eludes the intellect, which can only reflect upon itself and the layers of awareness beneath it. This pattern of emanatory expression continues as the intellect unfolds into psyche--comprising desire, emotion, passion, volition, and sense imagery--and from there into behavior. At this outermost level, awareness is least apparent, and its expression becomes observable, measurable, and predictable: the domain of physics and the hard sciences.

Olympians will "collect themselves" before an event--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, shifting feet, and a steady gaze. This ritual is essential for athletic performance--and for self-realization. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on that inner silence. The more practice you have with this, the more mastery you'll achieve over your attention.

Both self-realization and advanced knowledge of your fate will make you a better person and improve the quality of your life. The certainty that things will work out in the end makes dealing with everyday challenges a whole lot easier. It also generates a strong sense of purpose and hope, fueling your passions and staving off negativity and despair. The dark side to this is that you don't know the fate of others within your timeline. You'd essentially be selling false hope if you introduced Ourism to other people. The only real solution to this would be a collective merging of consciousnesses. This would require advanced bioengineering, most likely carried out by artificial intelligences--but as long as you're a part of it, your fate can be shared with others. Until something like that happens, nothing can be guaranteed to them.
