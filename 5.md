Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, and undivided ground of being. Its dissipates into thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures of the intellect. The intellect dissolves into the desires, emotions, passions, volitions, and perceptions of the psyche. Finally, awareness is completely dimished as the psyche transitions into observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable action.

Concentration is the reverse of this process, bringing one closer to the heart of their being. The art of centering--wiggling arms, deep breaths, a steady gaze, and shifting feet--is the key to this.
