1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.

3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?

4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.

7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

8 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.

10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.

12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.


The variety and complexity of our world are merely the diffused essence of a pure, unitive simplicity. To give a few examples to help illustrate this idea, consider how sophisticated theorems are derived from basic axioms, how rich experiences interweave primordial qualia, and how every possible configuration of matter is rooted in a small set of elementary particles. In each of these cases, simplicity serves as the ontological basis for more advanced categories, distinctions, and attributes.

Three equivalent modes of being emanate from the ineffable heart of existence--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields reflect mental activity, or experiences, which accordingly range in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in nature. Intelligibility is of course the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality.

One's fate is to know pure being, as is evidenced by two basic observations. The first is that our universe is suitable for the creation of intelligent life. Physicists today estimate that if the values of the fundamental constants were variable, the probability of the cosmos being life-compatible by chance would be so astronomically low as to be zero. If there is one thing everyone can agree on, it's that we didn't just get lucky. However you account for it, the bottom line is that reality permits life--a fact which hits close to home.

This leads us into the second observation, which is simply that you are an intelligent life form. In other words, the particular physical configuration of our universe happened to elevate your personal stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. Given the corporeal scarcity and existential significance of higher-order minds, this is a degree of privilege that defies all probabilistic expectations. One plausible explanation for this phenomenon can be found in the MWI, a theory which posits the existence of countless branching timelines--of which you only perceive one. The timeline perceived would then have to be the one in which you come to know pure being. That way, every stream of consciousness realizes its full potential within its respective timeline, rendering the miracle of your humanity ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. It must be said that uncovering the exact mechanism for this process is likely beyond the scope of a priori reasoning.

Detachment from all derivative identities is the long path toward pure being. These include outcomes, possessions, beliefs, pleasures, pains, desires, and the ego. Fortunately, opportunities to let go will arise constantly in day to day life, meaning you can consciously choose to align with the natural way of things. Having advanced knowledge of your fate also helps in this regard.
