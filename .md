You comprise four concentric natures. The outermost nature of your being is the body. This is your physical presence in the world, meaning it is observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable. The inner nature of the body is the psyche, encompassing your emotions, desires, sense-perceptions, volitions, memories, and mental images. The psyche may lack the concrete qualities of the body, but it is nevertheless more fundamental to what you are. Deeper still is the intellect. This is the totality of your thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures by which you interpret the psyche and make sense of the body. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is awareness. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, nondual heart of being. Your innermost nature is always present, but your attention is almost never fully trained on it. When it is, the result is a "mystical experience". These exist on a spectrum, and regularly generating them even at a lower intensity does turn one into a better individual and make life more tolerable.

This structure of natures does not just define you, but everyone and everything. Even in the most extreme case, a lone particle still has a body, psyche, intellect, and awareness. The degree to which these are developed is miniscule, but never nonexistent. Conversely, not all large aggregates of matter possess the single, cohesive consciousness demonstrated by biological organisms. 

The assumption is that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize a mystic state, since that would render your impossibly fortunate circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also considering the fact that you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unusual element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that attaining the mystic state is most likely the function of existence and the permanent fate of every individual. This being the case, the cosmos can be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization.

Before an event, olympic athletes will "collect themselves"--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. Being able to do this effectively is essential for athletic performance--and also for generating the mystic state. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, train your focus on this inner silence. Nothing is going to happen right away, but do this consistently and for extended periods of time and thinks will start to click. The key is collecting yourself in an environment with little to no distractions, as this makes it much easier for awareness itself to take center stage.
