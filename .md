The self is constituted by four concentric categories of being. The outermost category is the body, which is the observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable presence of an individual. Moving inward is the psyche, encompassing all emotions, desires, sense-perceptions, volitions, memories, and mental images. The psyche may lack the concrete qualities of the body, but it is nevertheless more fundamental to what it means to be you. Deeper still is the intellect. This is the totality of your thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures by which the psyche is interpreted and the body is made sense of. Finally, underlying the intellect is awareness. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, undivided heart of being. This innermost layer is always present, but attention is almost never fully trained on it. When it is, the result is a "mystical experience". These exist on a spectrum, and regularly generating them even at a lower intensity turns one into a better individual and makes life more tolerable.

Existence as a whole shares this same structure of being. Even in the most extreme case, a lone particle still possesses some degree of body, psyche, intellect, and awareness. Granted, the extent to which these are developed is miniscule and the distinction between the categories is almost nonexistent. On the other hand, not all large aggregates of matter possess the single, cohesive consciousness demonstrated by biological organisms.

We assume that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize a mystic state, since that would render your impossibly fortunate circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also considering the fact that you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unusual element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that attaining the mystic state is most likely the function of existence and the permanent fate of every individual. This being the case, the cosmos can be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization.

Before an event, olympic athletes will "collect themselves"--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. Being able to do this effectively is essential for athletic performance--and for generating the mystic state. Done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter, letting you know you're on the right track. If you collect yourself consistently and for extended periods of time, eventually things will start to click.
