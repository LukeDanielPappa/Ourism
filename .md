You comprise four concentric natures. The outermost nature of your being is the body. This is your physical presence in the world, meaning it is observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable. The inner nature of the body is the psyche, encompassing your emotions, desires, sense-perceptions, volitions, memories, and mental images. The psyche may lack the concrete qualities of the body, but it is nevertheless more fundamental to what you are. Deeper still is the intellect. This is the totality of your thoughts, ideas, concepts, beliefs, and understandings--the structures by which you interpret the psyche and make sense of the body. Finally, the inner nature of the intellect is awareness. Pure awareness is the blissful, timeless, noetic, nondual heart of being. 

This structure of natures does not just define you, but everyone and everything. Even in the most extreme case, a lone particle still has a body as well as inner experiences, including awareness. The degree to which these are developed is almost zero, but not nonexistent. On the flip side, not all large aggregates of matter possess the single, cohesive consciousness demonstrated by biological organisms. Buildings and cars don't have feelings.

Our innermost nature is always present, but we almost never train our full attention on it. This isn't because we lack moral fiber or a genius IQ, but because we just suck at focusing. Fortunately, there is a way to experience pure awareness and you already intuitively know how to do it. It's called "collecting yourself". You see Olympic athletes do it all the time--the tells are deep breaths, wiggling arms, a steady gaze, and shifting feet. If done correctly, one of the first things you'll experience is a cessation of mental chatter. Once that happens, surrender your focus to this inner silence. It takes serious effort, but eventually things will click. The trick is getting yourself in the right mood. Outdoor activities where you receive an immediate reward for being in a flow state are my go-to. Another thing I do is say the word "collect" in my head when I start to collect myself, further ritualizing the process. Once you get the hang of it you can do it anywhere. "Mystical experiences" exist on a spectrum, and regularly generating them even at a lower intensity does turn you into a better person and make life more tolerable, so it's definitely worthwhile to try all this. In fact, some even consider the mystic state to be the goal of life itself.

Regarding that last point, we all share the implicit assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, or otherwise expected. However, the truth is that your personal stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness simply because the prior configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it. There is no obvious reason for why that had to be the case, other than the possibility that every stream of consciousness perceives the timeline in which they realize a mystic state, since that would render your impossibly fortunate circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. This is also considering the fact that you happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent, which is yet another unusual element of fine-tuning in your life. All of this is to say that attaining the mystic state may actually be the function of existence and possibly the permanent fate of every individual. If this is really the case, then the cosmos could be interpreted as an eternal and unbounded act of self-realization. That should bring some comfort.
