The complex and multifaceted world we inhabit is the diffused essence of the monad, which is best described as a pure simplicity beyond all categories, distinctions, and attributes. To illustrate this point, consider how sophisticated theorems are derived from basic axioms, how rich experiences interweave primordial qualia, and how every possible configuration of matter is rooted in a small set of elementary particles. In each of these cases, simplicity serves as the ontological basis for the more advanced aspects of reality. From here it doesn't take a leap of faith to proclaim the monad as the ground of being.

More precisely, the monad is the ground of behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields reflect mental activity, or experiences, which accordingly range in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is of course the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality. In this way, what is behavioral is simultaneously experiential and intelligible, and what is experiential is also intelligible and behavioral, and so on.

We all share the unspoken assumption that existence as a human being is ordinary, unprivileged, and expected. However, the truth is that your stream of consciousness was elevated from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness because the configuration of our deterministic universe entailed it, defying all probabilistic expectations. One plausible solution to this problem can be found in the MWI, a theory which posits the existence of countless branching timelines--of which you only perceive one. The timeline perceived would then have to be the one in which you come to know pure being. That way, all streams of consciousness would achieve self-realization within their respective timelines, rendering your existential circumstances truly ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.

You also happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent. This is yet another degree of fine-tuning to your life, as the opportunity to progress beyond biological limitations by means of advanced technology is exceedingly rare, even among intelligent life-forms. It strongly suggests that your realization of pure being is meant to be permanent, something which might align with your intuitions.

Every healthy animal has the instinct to behave in accordance with the proliferation of their genes, with any deviation from this behavior inviting physical or psychological suffering. While this may lead some to the position of moral relativism, the bigger picture here is that all organisms are straining in their own unique way toward a single, objectively perfect way of life. Pure being is such perfection, and it is defined by complete mental detachment from all derivative identities. These include outcomes, possessions, desires, beliefs, pleasures, pains, the ego, and even pure being itself. The point is not to shun these things from your life, but simply to stop clinging to them. You can consciously work toward complete detachment or be dragged there by fate--the choice is yours to make.
