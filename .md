The multiplicity and complexity of our world are merely the diffused essence of pure, unitive simplicity. To help illustrate this, consider how sophisticated theorems are derived from basic axioms, how rich experiences interweave primordial qualia, and how every possible configuration of matter is rooted in a small set of elementary particles. In each of these cases, simplicity serves as the ontological basis for more advanced categories, distinctions, and attributes.

Three equivalent natures emerge from the ineffable source of being--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which can be observed, quantified, measured, and predicted. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields reflect mental activity, or experiences, which accordingly range in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Crucially, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is of course the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality.

The particular physical configuration of our universe happened to elevate your personal stream of consciousness from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness. Given the corporeal scarcity of higher-order minds, this is a privilege that defies all probabilistic expectations. One plausible way to explain it can be found in the MWI, a theory which posits the existence of countless branching timelines--of which you only perceive one. The timeline perceived would then have to be the one in which you come to know pure being. That way, all streams of consciousness would realize their full potential within their respective timelines, rendering your existential circumstances ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.

You also happen to be alive at a point in time where a technological singularity is imminent. This is yet another degree of fine-tuning to your life, as the opportunity to progress beyond biological limitations by means of advanced technology is exceedingly rare, even among intelligent life-forms. It strongly suggests that your realization of pure being is meant to be permanent, something which might align with your intuitions.

Every healthy animal has the instinct to behave in accordance with the proliferation of their species, with any deviation from this behavior inviting physical or psychological suffering. One may view this as manifesting in an explosion of diverging moralities, but the bigger picture here is that all organisms are ultimately converging from different angles on a singular, objectively perfect way of life. The moral perfection we all strive for is of course pure being, which can be defined as detachment from all derivative identities. These include outcomes, possessions, desires, beliefs, pleasures, pains, and the ego.
